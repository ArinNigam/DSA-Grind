// Reveal Cards In Increasing Order (Medium)

// You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].

// You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

// You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

// Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
// If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
// If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
// Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

// Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
// Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
// Explanation: 
// We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
// After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
// We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
// We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
// We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
// We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
// We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
// We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
// We reveal 17.
// Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
