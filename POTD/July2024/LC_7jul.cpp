// Water Bottles (Easy)

// There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.
// The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

// Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
// Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
// Output: 19
// Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
// Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
